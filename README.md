# PhilQuery

**PhilQuery** is a lightweight, citation-focused program to answer complex philosophical questions using high-quality academic sources â€” starting with the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (SEP). Unlike typical LLMs that hallucinate or oversimplify, PhilQuery grounds its answers in real text chunks and explicitly cites its sources.
