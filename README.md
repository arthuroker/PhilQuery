# PhilQuery

**PhilQuery** is a lightweight, citation-focused program to answer political philosophy questions â€” starting with primiary sources like The Social Contract by Jean-Jacques Rousseau. Unlike typical LLMs that hallucinate or oversimplify, PhilQuery grounds its answers in real text chunks and explicitly cites its sources.
