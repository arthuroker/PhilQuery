PhilQuery is an AI-powered research assistant for political philosophy. It answers questions using **only** the text provided in its index.  
Right now, it's running on a small set of curated sources, including:

- Jean-Jacques Rousseauâ€™s *The Social Contract* and early discourses

It uses semantic search (FAISS + sentence-transformers) to find relevant passages, then asks an LLM (via Groq) to answer based only on those chunks.  
All quotes are explicitly cited using a short excerpt from the original text.
