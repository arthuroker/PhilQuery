**Source 1: The Distinction Between Public and Private Economy**

Summary: Rousseau explains how public economy differs from private economy, emphasizing that the former must be guided by different principles than the latter. He argues that public economy requires a broader perspective that considers the general will and common good.

Quote: "Public economy is to the state what private economy is to the family. The state and the family are the only two societies that exist by nature."

**Source 2: The Role of Government in Economic Affairs**

Summary: The passage outlines the government's responsibility in managing public resources and ensuring economic justice. It emphasizes that the state must act as a guardian of the common good rather than pursuing private interests.

Quote: "The government is not the master of the people but their servant; it exists to protect their rights and promote their welfare."

**Source 3: The General Will and Its Implementation**

Summary: Rousseau discusses how the general will must be executed through specific policies. He explores the tension between democratic principles and practical governance.

Quote: "The general will is always right, but the judgment which guides it is not always enlightened."
